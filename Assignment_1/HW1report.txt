Assignment 1

For this assignment I have:
Die Class - Which will run the dice rolling system
TestDie Class - Which tests the Die Class to make sure that the probability is mildly correct
Die Constructor = Which initializes the global variables that will be used in later methods
roll() method - Which simulates the rolling of a 6 sided die
getTop() method - Which obtains the top value of the die

Testing Strategy:

To determine ifmy system is balanced, I created a test environment that would determine the probability
of rolling the die. This was done by rolling the die 1000 times and calculating the probability of each value
obtained.  This would allow for me to use the Die constructor with its methods to determine if they are working properly,
along with analyzing the outputs to see if all get a 1/6 chance of being rolled.  Since it is random they were not perfectly
1/6 like it should be, but they were very close.

The output of my test case are as follows:

The value of 1/6 is .166
The probability of getting a 1 is: 0.154
The probability of getting a 2 is: 0.159
The probability of getting a 3 is: 0.186
The probability of getting a 4 is: 0.151
The probability of getting a 5 is: 0.184
The probability of getting a 6 is: 0.166


This represents that the die would roll close to the 1/6 probability that a 6 sided die would be 
expected to have.
